ramdisk-devtools
================

This project provides an Ubuntu / Debian Linux environment with a RAM disk auto-loaded with development tools 
that benefit from memory-speed access. For example, both the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
and [Spring Tool Suite](http://www.springsource.org/sts) can bootstrap and run considerably faster when loaded
from a RAM disk.

A JSON configuration file dictates which tools are loaded and how they are mapped into the environment.


### Setup

Refer to the [Setup](https://github.com/brulejr/ramdisk-devtools/wiki/Setup) page for the manual installation 
instructions.

### Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/brulejr/ramdisk-devtools/wiki/Configuration) page for the details on 
tuning the RAM disk and its auto-loading of packages.
